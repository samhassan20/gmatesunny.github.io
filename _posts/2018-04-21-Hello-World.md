I was thinking from a long time to set up my own personal website based on **Jekyll** as I have heard a lot of good things about how easy it to blog with it. I also liked the idea of setting up a personal website rather using some blogging platform like **WordPress**, **Blogspot** etc, because it gives you lot of freedom in how you wanted to customize it.

So, today morning I thought let's do it even though I had other important works pending but it's okay, I will drink more coffee and hopefully will complete today's task.

I forked **Leonids** theme, did some changes according to my needs and see I have my personal website ready. It's easy and I highly recommend everyone to do the same.

#### So, I'm happy :)


- [x] Setup Jekyll based website.
{: style='list-style-type: none'}

As it is being setup, I will try to write more and keep it updated.
